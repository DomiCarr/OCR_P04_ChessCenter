    Compute new Elo values for two players after a match.

    The Elo system updates a player's Elo based on the difference
    between the expected outcome and the actual outcome of a match.

    Formula:
        NewElo = CurrentElo + K * (ActualScore - ExpectedScore)
    where:
        - CurrentElo = current Elo of the player
        - K = factor controlling Elo change magnitude
        - ActualScore = actual score of the player (1.0 win, 0.5 draw, 0.0 loss)
        - ExpectedScore = expected score based on both players' current Elo
          ExpectedScorePlayer1 = 1 / (1 + 10^((player2_current_elo -
                                              player1_current_elo)/400))

    Parameters:
        player1_current_elo (int): Current Elo of player 1.
        player2_current_elo (int): Current Elo of player 2.
        player1_score (float): Score of player 1 (1.0 win, 0.5 draw, 0.0 loss).
        k_factor (int): Elo factor (default 20).
