## 🧠 Application Architecture

ChessCenter is organized using a clean modular architecture based on the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern.
Each component has its own dedicated folder, making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.

- **Models** handle the core data structures (players, tournaments, matches, etc.)
- **Views** manage user interaction via the console
- **Controllers** coordinate logic between models and views
- **Data** stores persistent tournament and player information in JSON format

Here’s the overall project layout:

## 🚀 Installation Guide

> ⚠️ **Compatibility Note**
> This project requires **Python ≥ 3.10** and **pip ≥ 23.0** to ensure full compatibility with Flake8 and its HTML reporting plugin.
> 🐧 **Note macOS/Linux**
> On Linux/Mac, the `python` command may not be available by default.
> Use `python3` instead:

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DomiCarr/OCR_P04_ChessCenter
cd OCR_P04_ChessCenter
```

### 🛠️ Set up the virtual environment

Create and activate the virtual environment before installing packages or running the application.

Create:

```bash
python -m venv env
# If python doesn't work, use python3:
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate:

- **On macOS/Linux**
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows (CMD)**
  ```cmd
  env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On Windows (PowerShell)**
  ```powershell
  .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```

> 📝 **Note (PowerShell)**
> If you get an error like
> **“running scripts is disabled on this system”**,
> open PowerShell as administrator and run:
>
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
> ```
>
> Then confirm with `Y` to allow local scripts to run.


### 📦 Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ✅ Verify installation

Run the following to confirm packages are installed:

```bash
pip freeze
```

Expected output includes:

```text

## 🧪 Code Quality Report (Flake8)
![Flake8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-Flake8-blue)


To ensure code quality and compliance with PEP8 standards, this project uses **Flake8** with HTML reporting.

You can generate a detailed linting report by running the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python -m flake8 src/ --format=html --htmldir=flake8_rapport
# If python doesn't work, use python3:
python3 -m flake8 src/ --format=html --htmldir=flake8_rapport
```

This will create an HTML report in the `flake8_rapport/` directory.
You can open `flake8_rapport/index.html` in your browser to review warnings, errors, and style issues.

> ⚙️ **Configuration Note**
> Flake8 is configured via a `.flake8` file located at the root of the project.
> It sets the maximum line length to 119 characters, excludes folders like `env/`, `__pycache__/`, and `flake8_rapport/`, and enables HTML output in the `flake8_rapport/` directory.

> ✅ Tip: Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running the command.
