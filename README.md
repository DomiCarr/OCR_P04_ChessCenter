## 🧠 Application Architecture

ChessCenter is organized using a clean modular architecture based on the Model–View–Controller (MVC) pattern.
Each component has its own dedicated folder, making the codebase easy to navigate and maintain.

- **Models** handle the core data structures (players, tournaments, matches, etc.)
- **Views** manage user interaction via the console
- **Controllers** coordinate logic between models and views
- **Data** stores persistent tournament and player information in JSON format

Here’s the overall project layout:

## 🧪 Code Quality Report (Flake8)
![Flake8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-Flake8-blue)


To ensure code quality and compliance with PEP8 standards, this project uses **Flake8** with HTML reporting.

You can generate a detailed linting report by running the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
python -m flake8 src/ --format=html --htmldir=flake8_rapport
```

This will create an HTML report in the `flake8_rapport/` directory.
You can open `flake8_rapport/index.html` in your browser to review warnings, errors, and style issues.

> ✅ Tip: Make sure your virtual environment is activated before running the command.
